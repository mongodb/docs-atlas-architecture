       :ref:`arch-center-paradigms`.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Configure Network Security based on your organization's needs.
       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see
       :ref:`arch-center-auth`.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Choose a network connectivity method:
       
       - :ref:`VPC Peering <arch-center-vpc-vnet-peering>` for setting up
         private and secure traffic routing within your network boundaries.
       - :ref:`Private Endpoints <arch-center-private-endpoints>`
         (AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, or
         Google Cloud Private Service Connect) for a one-way private
         connection from your VPC to |service|.
         For sharded multi-region clusters, enable private endpoints in each region. To learn more, see :ref:`Recommendations for Multi-Region
         Deployments <arch-center-multi-region-recs-private-endpoints>`.
       - Public :ref:`IP Access Lists <arch-center-ip-access-list>`
         to restrict inbound connections to specific IP addresses or CIDR
         blocks. Consider IP Allow lists as an alternative to Private Link if necessary.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Confirm that TLS/SSL is enabled for encrypting connections to your
       databases. TLS is mandatory and is enabled by default and cannot
       be disabled. TLS 1.2 is the default. To learn more, see :ref:`<arch-center-tls>`.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - For on-premises connectivity to |service|, ensure that your organization
       completes all the necessary internal processes, which may take time for approvals.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Configure Authentication and Authorization. To get recommendations and
       learn more about this topic, see :ref:`arch-center-auth`.

       - Set up database users and roles with the principle of least privilege.
       - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage access
         across all resources.
       - Consider LDAP Integration for user authentication and authorization.
       - Consider setting up Federated Authentication, such as SAML 2.0,
         for UI access via identity providers, such as Okta, Entra ID,
         Ping Identity, or others.
       - Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
       - Secure |service| API access using API key-based authentication.
         Consider regular key rotation.
       - For database access in cloud environments, consider Workforce and
         Workload Identity Federation, such as OIDC, OAuth 2.0, AWS IAM roles,
         or Azure Managed Identities, for passwordless access.
       - Explore using X.509 client certificates for authentication.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Implement Robust Encryption. To learn more, see :ref:`arch-center-data-encryption`.
  
       - Encryption at rest is enabled by default using cloud providers'
         transparent disk encryption (AES-256).
       - Optionally enable "Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)" encryption using
         Key Management Service (KMS) providers (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault,
         or GCP KMS).|service| can't rotate customer-managed encryption keys.
       - Consider Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) to encrypt
         data within your application before transmitting it to |service|.
       - Explore Queryable Encryption for performing queries on encrypted data.


   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Configure Database Auditing to track database access and actions.
       Create custom filters if needed. To get recommendations and learn
       more about this topic, see :ref:`arch-center-auditing-logging`.
  
   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Be aware of hard-coded certificate authority certificates.
       |service| clusters use TLS certificates signed by a widely
       trusted Certificate Authority (CA). While applications using
       recent MongoDB drivers handle certificate validation automatically,
       older applications or those with custom TLS configurations might
       require updates to trust the new CA certificates if MongoDB updates
       its certificate provider.
       To learn more, see :atlas:`Hard-coded certificate authority </reference/faq/security/#hard-coded-certificate-authority>`.
       Ensure that you set up your applications in a way that lets you
       handle potential CA certificate updates.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Understand and plan for compliance with relevant standards and
       regulations, such as ISO/IEC 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS, FedRAMP,
       and others. To learn more, see :ref:`arch-center-compliance-atlas-gov`.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Enable |service| Cloud Backup, which provides localized backup
       storage using the cloud provider's native snapshot functionality.
       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see
       :ref:`arch-center-backups`.
  
   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Enable Continuous Cloud Backup with a restore window that meets
       your Recovery Point Objective (RPO). We recommend having a restore
       window of 7 days to allow for Point In Time (PIT) recovery using the oplog.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Define a backup schedule and retention policy that aligns with your
       business continuity and compliance requirements. Consider hourly,
       daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots with appropriate retention periods.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Consider :ref:`multi-region snapshot distribution <atlas-backup-distribution>`
       for increased resilience by copying snapshots to other geographic regions.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Enable :ref:`Backup Compliance Policy <atlas-backup-compliance>` to
       prevent unauthorized modifications or deletions of backups and comply
       with strict data protection requirements.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Understand the process for restoring from scheduled or on-demand snapshots.
       To learn more, see :ref:`backup-policy-recommendations`.

     - Plan and test your Disaster Recovery (DR) strategy. Understand
       Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
       Consider testing application's resilience in |service|.
       To learn more, see :ref:`arch-center-dr`.
  
   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Consider options for downloading and archiving snapshots, if required,
       using the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, or {+atlas-cli+}.
       To learn more, see :ref:`arch-center-resiliency`.

Maintenance and Patching

   * - Check
     - Action
  
   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Be aware that |service| deploys major version upgrades in a rolling
       manner to minimize downtime.

   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Define a Maintenance Window for |service| automated systems to apply
       automatic minor version updates. Configure the day and hour of
       allowed maintenance using the ``mongodbatlas_maintenance_window`` resource.
       To ee :ref:`arch-center-resiliency`.
  
   * - :icon-fa4:`square-o`
     - Understand that |service| has non-deferrable maintenance hours for critical security
       patches or operational necessities. Configure Protected Hours for your
       project and :atlas:`define a daily window </tutorial/cluster-maintenance-window/>`
       when standard updates cannot begin. |service| performs standard
       updates that don't involve cluster restarts or resyncs outside of these hours.
