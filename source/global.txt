Global {+service+} deployments are the most complex deployment paradigms, and 
therefore require very careful planning. In almost all cases, a 
a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-region` (or its subset, a
:ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`) will fulfill your needs.

The following are a few reasons why you might consider a global deployment 
strategy:

- You need a single global connection string 
- You need to perform global aggregations across all customers
- You need the ability to read/write for all customers from everywhere 
  in one logical cluster, while also having regional reads/writes

Recommendations for Global Deployments
--------------------------------------
The complexity of global deployments results in many opinions on best 
practices. This makes them difficult to adopt as a general solution.

The {+atlas-arch-center+} does not currently cover recommendations
specific to global deployments. Contact {+ps+} team to discuss your 
specific requirements and designing a {+service+} global deployment 
strategy.
