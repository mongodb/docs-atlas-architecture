Global {+service+} deployments set up {+cluster+} shards across up to
nine distinct zones that you define, where each zone supports write and
read operations from geographically local shards. {+service+} uses the
geographic location of the :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region in each
zone to construct a map of geographically-near countries and
subdivisions. The global deployment uses this map to serve content
and performs write from the region nearest a user.

Like multi-region
deployments, global deployments can enhance protection in the case of a
regional outage by automatically rerouting traffic to a
shard in another region for continuous availability and a
smooth user experience. However, global deployments differ from
multi-region deployments because they maximize performance around
latency reduction by serving content from regions closest to users,
rather than using a set priority region for all users.

To learn how to configure global deployments and learn about the
different types of nodes you can add, see 
:atlas:`Manage Global Clusters 
</global-clusters/>` in the {+service+}
documentation.

The following diagram shows a global {+service+}
deployment:

Use Case for Global Deployments
-------------------------------

Global deployments are best for the following use
case:

Global Applications that Require Low Latency and High Availability (One or More Cloud Providers)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve performance for critical operations,
all {+service+} deployments allow you to deploy data
close to your users' geographic location, which reduces latency.
However, deploying to a single region sacrifices high availability if
there is a regional outage, and using a multi-region deployment requires
region specificity. You can configure a global deployment for both
high availability and low latency for a global audience.

A global deployment may be best for you if you have
the following requirements:

- You want to use a single cloud provider *or* multiple cloud providers
- You want to deploy to more than one region for high availability
- Your application requires low latency *and* has global users, since
  global deployments serve content from the region closest to the user
  across zones that you specify.

For example, for an application deployed with |aws| with users
located globally, you can use a template to deploy a global deployment
to six :guilabel:`Highest Priority` regions, as shown in the following
image:

.. image:: /includes/images/global-template.png
   :alt: "An showing latency per geographic area for a global cluster with six regions."
   :width: 600px
   :align: center

The previous template deploys at least one shard per region for the 
following regions:

- N. Virginia (``us-east-1``)
- Oregon (``us-west-2``)
- Sao Paulo (``sa-east-1``)
- Frankfurt (``eu-central-1``)
- Singapore (``ap-southeast-1``)
- Tokyo (``ap-northeast-1``)

{+service+} uses the geographic location of your zones to serve content
and performs write from the region nearest a user. You can also
add additional nodes in other regions to each global {+cluster+} zone.
This ensures low latency from any location globally, while offering
high availability if there's a regional outage that affects the primary
shard.

If your application requires low latency for users in specific regions,
consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-region`.

If your application requires low latency for users in specific regions,
high availability, and deployment across multiple cloud providers,
consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`.

If your application requires low latency but doesn't require
cross-region high
availability, consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-single`.

specific to global deployments. Contact MongoDB's Professional Services
team to create a custom landing zone for your {+service+} global
deployments.
