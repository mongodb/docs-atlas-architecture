When deploying your database, you must choose between deploying to a single region or multiple regions. The following diagram 
shows these options, which are explained further below:

- A :ref:`single-region deployment <arch-center-paradigms-single>`, in which 
  your data is stored one of a provider's regions (such as AWS's ``us-west-2``).
- A multi-region deployment, in which you have data in at least one region in 
  multiple "geographies" (continents or large countries). A minimal example 
  is having your data in one region in the Europe geography and one in the Asia 
  Pacific geography. A more robust example of a multi-region deployment is 
  having clusters in 3 Asia-Pacific regions, one European region, and 3 US 
  regions.
- A Global deployment. This option exists for the most complex situations; for 
  example, where you need global aggregation of user data, or where legal terms 
  dictate specific hosting requirements.

The following diagram shows these options:

Single-Region Deployments
-------------------------

A :ref:`single-region deployment <arch-center-paradigms-single>` is the simplest deployment paradigm.
In a single-region deployment, your data is stored in one of a provider's regions (such as {+aws+}'s ``us-west-2`` 
or {+gcp+}'s ``asia-northeast3``). Because {+service+} always provides a 
minimum of zone-level availability, your cluster nodes are spread across the 
availability zones within a single region. Therefore, if a single zone fails, your 
data is still available in the other zones.

With the simplicity and lower cost of a single-region deployment 
comes the risk of lower availability and potentially higher latency, depending on the 
distribution of your application's users. 

Multi-Region Deployments
------------------------

A :ref:`multi-region deployment <arch-center-paradigms-multi-region>` is a more complex deployment paradigm that provides higher availability 
and low latency across a larger geographic range than a single-region deployment. There are several types of multi-region deployments:

- **Multi-region in one geography**:
  Deploys to multiple regions hosted by a single cloud provider 
  within a single geography, which is a large area like a country or continent.
  This ensures availability if any given region fails.

  For example, you deploy clusters to the {+aws+} regions ``us-west-1`` and ``us-east-1``,
  both of which are in the United States.

- **Multi-region in multiple geographies**:
  Deploys to one or more regions in two or more geographies.
  This ensures availability if any given region fails, or 
  if an entire geographic area is unavailable.

  For example, you deploy clusters in the {+aws+} regions ``us-east-1`` and ``us-east-2``, 
  both of which are in the United States, and a third cluster in ``eu-west-2``, 
  which is in Europe. 
  
- **Multi-cloud** : 
  Deploys to one or more regions hosted by multiple cloud providers. 
  This provides the highest level of availability, ensuring 
  your data is available if any given region fails or if an entire cloud provider fails. 

  For example, you deploy clusters in the {+aws+} region ``us-west-1`` and the {+gcp+} 
  region ``us-east4``. 

- **Global**:
  Deploys a global cluster with up to nine single or multi-region zones.
  Consider this option for only the most complex 
  situations; for example, where you need global aggregation of user data, or 
  where legal terms dictate specific hosting requirements.

Choosing a Deployment Paradigm
------------------------------

To figure out which deployment pattern is right for you, break down your 
applications by how critical they are to your core business. The 
more important the application (in other words, the more impact an 
outage has on your business), the more you should consider an architecture that  
automatically handles any outage event.

The following table provides a comparison of deployment paradigms to help you 
determine the best fit for your needs:

.. note::

   The cost of each deployment type depends on several factors, including the 
   provider(s) you select, the number of regions you need, the amount of storage, and 
   the processing power of the servers. For the latest pricing information, 
   refer to the `MongoDB Pricing <https://www.mongodb.com/pricing>`_.

Use Cases 
~~~~~~~~~

When choosing your deployment paradigm, start by identifying the smallest number of regions that you can deploy to serve 
the widest geographical distribution of your users. Then, consider adding additional regions or 
cloud providers according to your requirements for availability, performance, and
:ref:`data sovereignty <arch-center-compliance-data-sovereignty>`. 

Consider the following use cases to help decide which deployment paradigm works for the geographical distribution of your application's users: 

Users Mostly in One Geography
`````````````````````````````

If the majority of your application's users are located in one geography,
we recommend that you deploy to one or more regions within the same geography.
While a single-region deployment can protect against an outage in a single availability zone,
a multi-region deployment covers a larger geographical area and ensures availability during both zonal and regional outages.
For even higher availability, you can deploy across multiple regions *and* multiple cloud providers to protect against cloud-provider outages.
These options all support low latency and simplify compliance with data sovereignty requirements 
because all user data is accessed and stored within the same geography. 

To learn more about these deployment paradigms, see the following paradigm pages: 

- :ref:`Single-Region Deployment <arch-center-paradigms-single>`
- :ref:`Multi-Region Deployment in One Geography <arch-center-paradigms-multi-region>`
- :ref:`Multi-Region and Multi-Cloud Deployment in One Geography <arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud>`

Users Distributed Across Multiple Geographies
`````````````````````````````````````````````

If your application's users are distributed across multiple geographies, such as between the US and Europe,
we recommend that you deploy to one or more regions in each geography. 
Deploying to one region in each geography where you serve customers provides low latency and 
availability in case of a geographical outage. You can also meet data sovereignty requirements
by partitioning your data so that user data from each geography is hosted within that geography.

To ensure high availability in case of regional outages without increasing latency or violating data sovereignty requirements,
you can also deploy to multiple regions in each geography. You can achieve the highest availabilty for a multi-region deployment 
by deploying clusters to multiple regions, in multiple geographies, hosted by multiple cloud providers. 

To learn more about these deployment paradigms, see the following paradigm pages: 

- :ref:`Multi-Region Deployment in Multiple Geographies <arch-center-paradigms-multi-region>`
- :ref:`Multi-Region and Multi-Cloud Deployment in Multiple Geographies <arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud>`

Users Distributed Worldwide
```````````````````````````

If you are deploying an application to a worldwide audience, we recommend that you deploy a multi-region deployment 
across multiple geographies before considering a global deployment. Global |service| deployments are the most complex multi-region deployment paradigms,
and therefore require very careful planning. In most cases, a multi-region deployment in multiple geographies can fulfill your requirements
for high availability, low latency, and data sovereignty.
