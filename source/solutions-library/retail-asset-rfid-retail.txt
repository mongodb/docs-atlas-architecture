Solution Overview
-----------------

Retailers must ensure accurate and consistent inventory information
across multiple channels while handling vast amounts of data. However,
traditional methods struggle to keep pace with the demands of today's
dynamic market.

In this scenario, RFID Technology offers a transformative solution. By
automatically tracking tagged items using electromagnetic fields,
retailers gain unprecedented real-time visibility into inventory levels.
This implementation optimize stock management, reduce labor
costs, and elevate customer satisfaction.

Harnessing RFID's potential requires a robust data layer. MongoDB Atlas
provides the solution for capturing, processing, and analyzing these
massive datasets.

**Key benefits**

- **Inventory accuracy:** Eliminate stock discrepancies and reduce
  out-of-stocks, ensuring products are where customers expect them to be.

- **Operational efficiency:** Streamline processes like receiving,
  picking, and packing, leading to faster turnaround times and cost
  savings.

- **Enhanced customer experience:** Fulfill orders accurately and
  quickly, boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty.

- **Data-driven insights:** Leverage detailed product and sales data to make
  informed business decisions and optimize product assortment.

By adopting RFID and complementing it with a powerful database solution,
retailers can overcome the challenges of product information management
and achieve a competitive advantage.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

By attaching RFID tags to products and utilizing a network of readers,
businesses can accurately track items from the manufacturing floor to
the end consumer. Below, we'll explain the general architecture of an
RFID system and then provide a specific example using Zebra
Technologies.

Supply Chain Tracking with RFID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This architecture outlines a comprehensive system for monitoring product
movement throughout the supply chain using RFID Technology. MongoDB
Atlas serves as the underlying data layer for managing and analyzing
RFID data.

Key Components and Functions
````````````````````````````

- **RFID data collection:** Information is captured from RFID tags
  attached to products using RFID readers.

- **Data management:** MongoDB Atlas stores and processes collected RFID
  data.

- **Data analysis:** The system utilizes MongoDB Atlas to extract
  valuable insights from the data through data cleaning, transformation,
  and analysis.

- **Workflow optimization:** The architecture visualizes the data flow
  from initial collection to the generation of actionable insights.

RFID Product Tracking Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the help of an RFID product tracking architecture, we aim to
showcase an example that integrates the Zebra Technologies 123RFID app
with the Atlas developer data platform using an API gateway.

**Key Components and Functionalities**

- **RFID data capture:** The Zebra Technologies 123RFID app collects product
  information via RFID tags.

- **Data integration:** An API gateway seamlessly transfers RFID data
  from the app to MongoDB Atlas.

- **Data storage and analysis:** MongoDB Atlas serves as the central
  repository for RFID data, enabling comprehensive data analysis.

Building the Solution
---------------------

In this guide, we will explore how a retail RFID product tracking
application can integrate with MongoDB Atlas and how to use it to
efficiently handle inventory checks.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Set Up MongoDB Atlas

      Cluster Setup
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
      - Select a cloud provider.

      - Choose a region.

      - Configure cluster specifications (e.g., instance size, storage).

    Network Security
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      - Configure network access

      - Identify IP access list for edge devices and application
        servers.

      - User authentication

      - Create a database user with read and write permissions for the
        inventory database.

    Connection
    ~~~~~~~~~~

      - Obtain connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

      - Use connection string to connect your application to the
        cluster.

   .. step:: Create Dataworkz RAG Application

      Sign up to Dataworkz and create a RAG app for the e-commerce
      policies. You can use the PDF `inside the repository
      <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/retail-store-v2/blob/main/resources/LeafyCorpPolicy.pdf>`__
      to use as the e-commerce policy document. This is the unstructured
      data that can be made available as a tool to a Dataworkz Agent.

   .. step:: Create the Dataworkz Agent

      Connect to your MongoDB cluster provisioned at the previous step.
      Follow `this guide
      <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/retail-store-v2/blob/main/resources/chatbot/README.md>`__
      to learn the configuration required by the Dataworkz connector to
      access MongoDB. After that, create a MongoDB tool and a Dataworkz
      agent and test the agent.

   .. step:: Configure Your Applicationâ€™s Frontend

      Obtain the demo code by cloning the `GitHub repository
      <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/retail-store-v2>`__
      to your local machine, configure the environment variables and
      install the dependencies. Finally, run the app locally at
      http://localhost:8080.

configuration files, and tutorial videos, visit the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/retail-store-v2>`__.
