Leveraging MongoDB with Dataworkz
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

​​By leveraging the strengths of both MongoDB and Dataworkz,
organizations can create powerful, scalable, and accurate generative AI
applications while minimizing development complexity and time-to-market.

Dataworkz streamlines the process of creating RAG pipelines by providing
a point-and-click experience to extract unstructured data in any format,
configure a chunking strategy, and create vector embeddings. Dataworkz
RAG builder also allows developers to choose different retrieval
mechanisms—lexical, semantic, or graph, with different thresholds to
build the context for answering a user question.

The integration also enables real-time data processing and analytics,
which is essential for generative AI applications that require
up-to-date information. This capability ensures that AI models have
access to the most current data, improving the accuracy and relevance of
generated responses.

Agentic RAG Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build something transformational, conventional RAG systems, which
primarily utilize vector search techniques, must be integrated with
up-to-date information from operational databases. 

`MongoDB Atlas Vector Search
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-search>`__ provides
built-in support for vector embeddings, which eliminates the need for a
separate vector database, simplifying the architecture and reducing
complexity.

That’s where agentic RAG shines. With Dataworkz agents, retailers can
provide governed access to MongoDB collections, which are configured as
tools. In many cases, customers have an API layer that abstracts the
underlying collections—Dataworkz can be integrated with REST API or
GraphQL. 

Additionally, any RAG pipeline configured in Dataworkz can be made
available as a tool to an agent. This gives agents the ability to
understand unstructured data in a SharePoint site, a confluence wiki
page, or markdown depending on the user’s question.

Existing retailers with applications that leverage MongoDB as their data
platform will benefit from Dataworkz’s close integration with MongoDB
and leap-frog their AI adoption to incorporate agentic RAG into their
solutions. 

Dataworkz agents can access multiple data sources and use reasoning LLMs
to decide which tool to use to answer a user’s question. An agent can
dynamically switch between different MongoDB collections or even
multiple databases to bring in structured data such as shipping status,
customer profiles and preferences, and order histories. Additionally,
third party solutions like ERP (Epicor), CRM (Salesforce), and more can
be integrated through APIs exposed via the providers. Internal services
exposed as GraphQL is another popular type of integration. Together,
these tools enable the agent to understand the user’s questions in their
context and provide very personalized responses relevant to their
experience and their data. 

The way a Dataworkz Agent works is: 

1. Dataworkz agent framework partitions use cases into scenarios, such
   as being able to answer questions about store policies, provide
   recommendations, or search for an order. Scenarios have a curated set of
   tools relevant to the scenario. When a user interacts with the agent, a
   classifier selects the appropriate scenario. 

#. The agent then employs a reasoning LLM to come up with a plan to
   answer the question. Given the user’s question, the conversation
   context, memory, and the tools (such as access to a MongoDB collection)
   in the scenario, the LLM comes up with a sequence of steps to retrieve
   information to answer the question. This process is iterative; after
   each iteration, it’s a good idea to conclude by determining if enough
   context has been retrieved via the tools or if more iterations,
   planning, and execution are required to build more context.

#. Finally, the context constructed in step 2 is used by the agent to
   generate the necessary response or perform any action, or it might
   decide that it actually needs to ask the user a clarifying question.

Dataworkz brings the same ease of use to agents as it has to building
RAG applications. Instead of requiring coding with libraries or
frameworks, Agents are created by simply describing their intended
functionality. They can be built declaratively, tested using built-in
tools, and seamlessly deployed via an API when ready. This approach
makes agents far more accessible and significantly more cost-effective
to develop and deploy.

Building the Solution
---------------------

Building this solution can be broken down in four major steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Replicate the Demo Database

      You can either use a publicly hosted, pre-populated cluster or
      provision your own cluster within your Atlas account and populate
      your database with the required data for the demo. If you choose
      to bring your own MongoDB, a data dump can be found `inside the
      repository
      <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/retail-store-v2/tree/main/dump/leafy_popup_store>`__
      to quickly replicate the database with all the necessary data and
      metadata with one quick `mongorestore
      <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongorestore/>`__
      command.

   .. step:: Create Dataworkz RAG Application

      Sign up to Dataworkz and create a RAG app for the e-commerce
      policies. You can use the PDF `inside the repository
      <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/retail-store-v2/blob/main/resources/LeafyCorpPolicy.pdf>`__
      to use as the e-commerce policy document. This is the unstructured
      data that can be made available as a tool to a Dataworkz Agent.

   .. step:: Create the Dataworkz Agent

      Connect to your MongoDB cluster provisioned at the previous step.
      Follow `this guide
      <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/retail-store-v2/blob/main/resources/chatbot/README.md>`__
      to learn the configuration required by the Dataworkz connector to
      access MongoDB. After that, create a MongoDB tool and a Dataworkz
      agent and test the agent.

   .. step:: Configure Your Application’s Frontend

      Obtain the demo code by cloning the `GitHub repository
      <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/retail-store-v2>`__
      to your local machine, configure the environment variables and
      install the dependencies. Finally, run the app locally at
      http://localhost:8080.
