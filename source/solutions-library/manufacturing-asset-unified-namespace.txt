Solution Overview
-----------------

Manufacturing is experiencing a profound transformation through the
integration of real-time data and centralized data management tools like
the Unified Namespace (UNS) model. Modern factories generate vast
amounts of data from various systems like enterprise resource planning
(ERP), manufacturing execution system (MES), and shop floor machines. As
manufacturers move towards connected and automated systems, unifying
these data sources is crucial. `Deloitte reports
<https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/manufacturing/manufacturing-industry-outlook.html>`__
that smart factory initiatives can boost productivity by up to 12% and
improve equipment effectiveness by up to 20%. Achieving these gains
requires an effective data management strategy, one that leverages UNS
models supported by robust solutions like MongoDB.

The unified approach facilitates real-time data visibility and seamless
integration, helping to optimize processes and enhance operational
efficiency. By breaking down traditional hierarchical data flows,
manufacturers can leverage both historical and real-time insights for
strategic planning and continuous improvements.

An effective UNS system proactively integrates and contextualizes data,
taking steps to achieve organizational objectives without needing
constant human intervention. Rather than merely reporting isolated data
points, a UNS using MongoDB can autonomously unify and analyze data from
diverse manufacturing systems, uncover critical insights, and facilitate
informed decision-making.

In this solution, we develop a comprehensive Unified Namespace framework
using MongoDB’s capabilities for flexible data modeling, real-time
processing, and scalability.

The setup ingests various operational data types, analyzes streams for
actionable insights, stores the information in MongoDB, and provides
strategic recommendations based on comprehensive analytics with data
from different sources and types.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

Machine Prioritization Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This architecture leverages RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) to
determine which machines require predictive maintenance. The system
processes two types of input data: 

- Structured data: Production parameters and machine breakdown frequency. 
- Unstructured data: Institutional knowledge in documents. 

The workflow aggregates and operationalizes both data types as vector
embeddings in MongoDB Atlas. Using Vector Search, it performs semantic
search to provide relevant context to an LLM (via Amazon Bedrock or Cohere
in this case), which generates contextual responses to prioritization
queries. This helps maintenance teams make data-driven decisions about
which machines need attention first.

Sensor Data Processing Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This real-time architecture processes machine sensor data through six
key stages: 

1. Data collection: A prioritized milling machine with DAQ
   (data acquisition) captures critical metrics (product type, temperature,
   speed, torque, tool wear). 
#. Stream processing: Real-time transformation of
   raw sensor data. 
#. Data storage: Centralized storage in MongoDB Atlas with
   single view capability. 
#. Change detection: Monitoring for significant data
   changes. 
#. ML inference: Running trained models to predict potential
   failures. 
#. Dual output: Visualization through Atlas Charts and mobile
   notifications via Change Streams.

Work Order Generation Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This architecture automates maintenance work order creation through:

1. Document processing: Machine manuals and old work orders are chunked
   and converted to vectors using AWS/Cohere embedding models. 

#. Vector storage: Embeddings stored in MongoDB Atlas. 

#. Work order generation: A specialized app that: 

   - Uses LLMs to generate appropriate work order templates. 
   - Pulls inventory and resource information through aggregation. 
   - Creates detailed repair plans based on machine documentation.

Maintenance Guidance Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This architecture enhances operator instructions through a RAG approach:

1. Service note processing: Converts multilingual PDF service notes to text.
#. Translation: Processes non-English content (Spanish in this case)
   through translation models. 
#. Instruction generation: Combines translated service notes with
   original repair plans using LLMs.
#. Delivery: Provides updated maintenance instructions to technicians
   through a mobile app.

   :alt: RAG workflow diagram

Each architecture integrates with MongoDB Atlas core capabilities while
leveraging external services (Amazon Bedrock, OpenAI, Cohere) for AI/ML
functionality, creating a comprehensive predictive maintenance solution.
