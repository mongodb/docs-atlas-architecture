Solution Overview  
-----------------  
  
Imagine being able to offer your customers personalized, usage-based
premiums that take into account their driving habits and behavior. To do
this, you'll need to gather data from connected vehicles, send it to a
machine learning platform for analysis, and then use the results to
create a personalized premium for your customers. You’ll also want to
visualize the data to identify trends and gain insights. This unique,
tailored approach will give your customers greater control over their
insurance costs while helping you to provide more accurate and fair
pricing.

In the GitHub repo, you will find detailed, step-by-step instructions on
how to build the data upload and transformation pipeline leveraging
MongoDB Atlas platform features, as well as how to generate, send, and
process events to and from Databricks.

**By the end of this demo, you’ll have created a data visualization with
Atlas Charts that tracks the changes of automated insurance premiums in
near real-time:**

Other Applicable Industries and Use Cases  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  
**Financial Services**: Banks and financial institutions must be able to
make sense of time-stamped financial transactions for trading, fraud
detection, and more.

**Retail**: Real-time insights into what’s going on right now.

**Healthcare**: From the modes of transportation to the packages
themselves, IoT sensors enable supply chain optimization while
in-transit and on-site.

Data Model Approach  
-------------------  
  
A basic example data model to support this use case would include
customers, the trips they take, the policies they purchase, and the
vehicles insured by those policies.

This example builds out three MongoDB collections, as well two
materialized views. The full Hackloade data model which defines all the
MongoDB objects within this example can be found on GitHub.
