|service-fullname| supports a variety of authorization methods to
ensure robust access to resources. |service| requires all users to authenticate. 
Once the user is authenticated, authorization determines the user's access to 
resources.

When implementing |service| authorization, you must use 
:ref:`Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) <arch-center-rbac>`. Using an 
:ref:`Identity Federation Provider's <arch-center-fip>` groups with RBAC 
simplifies management.

The following recommendations apply to both workforce (human) and workload 
(application) users in all :ref:`deployment paradigms <arch-center-paradigms>`.

Recommendations for Authorization: Single-Region and Multi-Region
------------------------------------------------------------------

.. collapsible::
   :heading: Single-Region Deployment Recommendations
   :sub_heading: Recommendations that apply only to deployments in a single region
   :expanded: true

   Single-region deployments have no unique considerations for authorization.
   See the next section for "All Deployment Paradigm Recommendations".

.. collapsible::
   :heading: Multi-Region and Multi-Cloud Deployment Recommendations
   :sub_heading: Recommendations that apply only to deployments across multiple regions or multiple cloud providers
   :expanded: true

   Multi-region and multi-cloud deployments have no unique considerations
   for authorization. See the next section for "All Deployment Paradigm Recommendations".

All Deployment Paradigm Recommendations
---------------------------------------

The following recommendations apply to all :ref:`deployment paradigms
<arch-center-paradigms>`.

.. _arch-center-rbac:

RBAC and Predefined Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to simplify management of user 
authorization. |service| includes predefined 
:atlas:`user roles </reference/user-roles/>` that 
provide specific levels of access commonly needed for managing the |service| with 
the UI and APIs. To simplify management, you can then map the roles to to 
:abbr:`IdP (Identity Provider)` groups.

For connecting to |service| {+clusters+}, use fine-grained custom database roles 
to provide granular scoping based on the access required for the role to perform 
its function. This approach enables you to follow the principle of least privilege.

.. note:: 
   You should always restrict access by assigning the lowest-needed RBAC roles.
   You should also use domain restrictions.

There are two levels of roles that you can assign: organization-level and 
project-level.

Organization-Level Roles
`````````````````````````

Organization-level roles are used by service accounts to automate tasks 
such as creating new projects, managing IAM, and billing. They may also be 
used for platform team members.

* The ``Organization Owner`` role should be heavily restricted and not assigned
  to a human, as it has the ability to change organization-wide settings and delete 
  configurations. This role should be assigned to a service account which you use 
  only to initially set up and configure the organization. Minimize configuration 
  changes after the initial creation. To avoid account lockouts, you
  can create the following items: 
  
  - SAML Organization Owner group with :ref:`arch-center-just-in-time`. 
  - Service account with the Organization Owner role. Keep it in a
    secure place with strong access management for break-glass
    emergency scenarios.

* The ``Organization Member`` role should be for admins on the operations and 
  platform team that can view settings and configuration for the organization.

* The ``Organization Project Creator`` role should be a programmatic service 
  account used to create projects on behalf of new applications for development 
  and product teams.

* The ``Organization Billing Admin`` role should be a programmatic service 
  account used to pull invoices programmatically from the Billing API 
  and feed them into your FinOps tool. This same service account should have 
  access to all linked organizations for which it is responsible for reporting usage. 

Project-Level Roles
`````````````````````

Project-level roles are for the development, test, and product teams that are 
responsible for application development and maintenance. As with 
organization-level roles, you should always follow the principle of least 
privilege. For example, the ``Project Owner`` role should only be used for 
governance enforced by the operations and provisioning team. Because a Project
Owner can create and delete {+clusters+}, you should assign this role to a 
programmatic service account unless you are working in a sandbox environment.

To learn more about project-level roles, see:

- :atlas:`Atlas User Roles </reference/user-roles/>`
- :atlas:`<mongodb-users-roles-and-privileges>`.

.. _arch-center-fip:

Federated Identity Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By integrating |service| with a federated identity provider, 
you can use just-in-time provisioning by mapping identity provider groups to 
|service| roles. This streamlines access management and ensures secure and 
organized role assignments throughout the platform. You can grant access 
programmatically based on the provisioning process of your orchestration layer.

You should use a modern Federated Identity Provider (FIP) that 
provides SSO, such as Azure Entra ID, Okta, or Ping Identity. 
This makes the authorization process more secure and supports the 
flexibility needed to programmatically assign :abbr:`IdP (Identity Provider)` 
groups to |service| roles. You should restrict access to your company's domain, 
which prevents users from logging into |service| when they are not authorized 
for access.

To learn more about mapping roles to Federated Identity provider groups, see
:atlas:`Role Mapping Process </security/manage-role-mapping/#role-mapping-process>`. 

.. _arch-center-just-in-time:

Just-in-Time Access 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| also supports creating temporary database users
that automatically expire after the predefined times. A user can be
created for 6 hours, 1 day, or 1 week.

Authorization Example
---------------------

The following example shows how to configure Authorization with 
:ref:`HashiCorp Terraform provider <getting-started-terraform>`. For an example 
of configuring authentication with Terraform, see the 
:ref:`Authentication Examples <arch-center-auth_examples>`.

Use the following to grant users admin rights on the {+cluster+} and project member rights for the projects in the {+cluster+}.
