|service-fullname| supports a variety of authentication methods to
ensure robust security. |service| requires all users to authenticate to 
access the {+atlas-ui+}, |service| databases, and  the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. note:: 

   In this context, a "user" can be a human or an application. We refer to 
   human users as "Workforce Identity" and applications as "Workload Identity".

Two factors determine which authentication types to use: 

- The identity type (human or machine)
- The resource that the identity needs access to. The resource can be one
  of the following: |service| UI, |service| Database, or |service| APIs).

Recommendations for {+service+} Authentication: Single-Region and Multi-Region
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. collapsible::
   :heading: Single-Region Deployment Recommendations
   :sub_heading: Recommendations that apply only to deployments in a single region
   :expanded: false

   Singe-region deployments have no unique considerations for authentication.
   See the next section for "All Deployment Paradigm Recommendations".

.. collapsible::
   :heading: Multi-Region and Multi-Cloud Deployment Recommendations
   :sub_heading: Recommendations that apply only to deployments across multiple regions or multiple cloud providers
   :expanded: false

   For authentication through the :ref:`Workforce Identity Federation <arch-center-workforce_if>`,
   use a globally-distributed identity provider.

All Deployment Paradigm Recommendations
---------------------------------------

The following recommendations apply to all :ref:`deployment paradigms
<arch-center-paradigms>`.

|service| UI Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Workforce Users

  Use IP access restrictions, and then either:

  - Use :ref:`Federated Authentication <arch-center-federated_auth>` with an SAML 2.0 
    identity provider, such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, or Ping Identity, or 
  - Use Atlas credentials with 
    :ref:`Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) <arch-center-mfa>`.

- Workload Users
  
  This only applies to Workforce users.

|service| Database Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Workforce Users

  Use :ref:`Workforce Identity Federation <arch-center-workforce_if>`.

  For development and test environments, you can also use 
  :ref:`SCRAM <arch-center-scram>`. Consider :ref:`creating temporary database 
  users <arch-center-just-in-time>` with just-in-time database access.

- Workload Users

  Use one of the following:

  - :ref:`Workload Identity Federation <arch-center-workload_if>`
  - :ref:`AWS-IAM authentication <arch-center-iam>`
  - :ref:`X.509 <arch-center-x509>` certificates

  For development and test environments, you can also use 
  :ref:`X.509 <arch-center-x509>` certificates or :ref:`SCRAM <arch-center-scram>`.

|service| API Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   This applies to both Workforce and Workload users.

Use :ref:`<arch-center-admin-service-accounts>`. 
For development and test environments, you can also use 
:ref:`<arch-center-admin-service-accounts>` or :ref:`<arch-center-admin-api-keys>`.

Authentication Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections provide details about the authentication methods used when 
accessing the {+atlas-ui+}, |service| Database, or the {+atlas-admin-api+}.

.. _arch-center-federated_auth:

Federated Authentication
`````````````````````````

Federated authentication allows you to manage all authentication to
the {+atlas-ui+} across multiple systems and applications through a
central identity provider, which reduces user management complexity. With 
federated authentication, you can enforce security policies such as password 
complexity, credential rotation, and :abbr:`MFA (Multi-Factor
Authentication)` within your identity provider's tools. 

For the {+atlas-ui+}, you can use any :abbr:`SAML (Security Assertion
Markup Language) 2.0` compatible identity provider such as Okta, Microsoft
Entra ID, or Ping Identity.

.. _arch-center-workforce_if:

Workforce Identity Federation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Workforce Identity Federation allows you to manage all authentication to 
the |service| database through your identity provider. To learn more, 
see :ref:`oidc-authentication-workforce`.

.. _arch-center-workload_if:

Workload Identity Federation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Workload Identity Federation enables applications running in cloud
environments like |azure| and Google Cloud to authenticate with
|service| without the need to manage separate database user credentials.
With Workload Identity Federation, you can manage |service| database
users using |azure| Managed Identities, Google Service Accounts, or any
OAuth 2.0-compliant service. These authentication mechanisms simplify
management and enhance security by allowing for passwordless access to
the |service| database. 

.. _arch-center-iam:

AWS IAM Role Authentication
````````````````````````````

You can also authenticate through |aws| |iam| roles. To learn more, 
see :ref:`set-up-pwdless-auth`.

To learn more, see :ref:`oidc-authentication-workload` and 
:ref:`atlas-federated-authentication`.

.. _arch-center-mfa:

Multi-Factor Authentication 
`````````````````````````````

For any human user that has access to the |service| control plane, we recommend 
:abbr:`MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)` for enhanced security. When 
:abbr:`MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)` is enabled, |service| requires 
two forms of identification: 

- The user's credentials 
- One of the following recommended factors: 

  - Security keys
  - Biometrics
  - OTP authenticators 
  - Push notifications
  - SMS (not recommended as primary factor)
  - Email (not recommended as primary factor)

.. note::
   
   If you are using Federated Auth, you configure and manage MFA in the 
   :abbr:`IdP (Identity Provider)`. If you are using |service| credentials, 
   MFA is configured and managed within |service|. MFA is required when 
   using |service| credentials.

To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-enable-mfa`.

.. _arch-center-x509:

X.509 Client Certificates 
```````````````````````````

X.509 certificates provide the security of mutual TLS, 
making them suitable for staging and production environments, and you
can bring your own certificate authority for use with X.509.
The disadvantage of X.509 is that you must manage certificates and
the security of these certificates on the application side, while
Workload Identity Federation allows for password-less access and easier
application security.

To learn more, see :manual:`X.509 </core/security-x.509/>`.

.. _arch-center-scram:

SCRAM Password Authentication
```````````````````````````````

|service| clusters support SCRAM password authentication for user authentication, 
but we recommend SCRAM only for use in development and test environments. 

If you leverage X.509 or SCRAM authentication, we recommend that you use 
a third-party secrets manager like 
`HashiCorp Vault <https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/databases/mongodbatlas>`__
or |aws| Secrets Manager to generate and store complex database credentials. 

To learn more, see :manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram/>`.

.. _arch-center-admin-service-accounts:

Service Accounts
`````````````````

Service accounts use industry-standard OAuth2.0 to securely authenticate
with {+service+} through the {+atlas-admin-api+}. We recommend that you use 
service accounts instead of |api| keys when possible because they provide added 
security through use short-lived access tokens and required credential rotations.

You can manage programmatic access for service accounts only by using the 
{+atlas-ui+} or the {+atlas-admin-api+}. You can't manage programmatic access 
for service accounts through the {+atlas-cli+} or Terraform.

To learn more, see :atlas:`Service Accounts Overview </api/service-accounts-overview/>`.

.. _arch-center-admin-api-keys:

API Keys
`````````

Service accounts are the preferred method of authentication. {+service+}  
provides legacy support for |api| key-based authentication for managing 
programmatic access. |api| key-based authentication uses |http| Digest 
authentication to protect requests. To learn more, see :ref:`api-authentication`.

.. _arch-center-secrets:

Secrets Management
```````````````````

We recommend using a third-party secrets manager like `HashiCorp Vault
<https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/databases/mongodbatlas>`__
or |aws| Secrets Manager to generate and store complex database credentials.
A secrets manager can generate database credentials dynamically based on configured
roles for |service| databases. 

To learn more, see the blog :website:`Manage
MongoDB Atlas Database Secrets in HashiCorp Vault 
</blog/post/manage-atlas-database-secrets-hashicorp-vault>`.
