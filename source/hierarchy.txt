   .. tab:: Dev and Test Environments
      :tabid: devtest

      .. include:: /includes/shared-settings-clusters-devtest.rst

   .. tab:: Staging and Prod Environments
      :tabid: stagingprod

      .. include:: /includes/shared-settings-clusters-stagingprod.rst

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: CLI
      :tabid: cli

      .. note::

         Before you
         can create resources with the {+atlas-cli+}, you must:

         - :atlas:`Create your paying organization 
           </billing/#configure-a-paying-organization>` and :atlas:`create an API key </configure-api-access/>` for the
           paying organization.
         - :atlascli:`Install the {+atlas-cli+} </install-atlas-cli/>` 
         - :atlascli:`Connect from the {+atlas-cli+} 
           </connect-atlas-cli/>` using the steps for :guilabel:`Programmatic Use`.

      - :ref:`atlas-organizations-list`
      - :ref:`atlas-organizations-users-list`

      Create the Projects

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-create-projects.rst

      For more configuration options and info about this example, 
      see :ref:`atlas-projects-create`.

      To get the project IDs, see the following command:

      - :ref:`atlas-projects-list`

      Create One Deployment Per Project
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Dev and Test Environments
            :tabid: devtest

            For your development and testing environments, run the following command for each project that you created:

            .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-create-clusters-devtest.rst

         .. tab:: Staging and Prod Environments
            :tabid: stagingprod

            For your staging and production environments, create the following ``cluster.json`` file for each project that you
            created:

            .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-json-example-create-clusters.rst

            After you create the ``cluster.json`` file, run the
            following command for each project that you created. The
            command uses the ``cluster.json`` file to create a cluster.

            .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-create-clusters-stagingprod.rst 

      For more configuration options and info about this example, 
      see :ref:`atlas-clusters-create`.
