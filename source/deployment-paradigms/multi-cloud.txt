Multi-cloud {+service+} deployments are a special case of multi-region deployment
in which you set up {+cluster+} nodes across 
multiple geographic regions *and* multiple cloud providers. Multi-cloud
deployments enhance protection in the case of a regional outage or
cloud provider outage by automatically rerouting traffic to a
node in another region for continuous availability and a
smooth user experience. Multi-cloud deployments can also protect
against vendor lock-in, enhance performance, and help meet
compliance requirements for :ref:`data sovereignty
<arch-center-compliance-data-sovereignty>`.

{+service+} supports multi-cloud deployment across any combination of 
|aws|, |azure|, and {+gcp+}. 

To learn how to configure multi-cloud deployments and learn about the
different types of nodes you can add, see 
:atlas:`Configure High Availability and Workload Isolation 
</cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/>` in the {+service+}
documentation.

Use Cases for Multi-Cloud Deployments
-------------------------------------

The following image shows a multi-region, multi-cloud {+service+}
deployment for regions that support availability zones. Note that this differs 
from a multi-region deployment only in that multiple cloud providers are 
used.

   :alt: An image showing a five-node deployment spread across three regions and two cloud providers. Each region contains one zone per node.

A multi-region, multi-cloud deployment may be best for you if you have
the following requirements:

- Have critical operations that require the highest level of availability.
- Want to move your data to different cloud providers in response to 
  provider changes (such as pricing models)
- Have governing regulations that dictate which regions your data can be stored in, 
  and by which providers. For example, for an application that 
  requires data storage in Europe, you can deploy a multi-region,
  multi-cloud deployment to three regions within the EU (such as
  ``eu-west-1`` and ``eu-west-2`` for |aws|, and ``uksouth`` for |azure|).
  This ensures data sovereignty since all regions are within the EU, while
  offering high availability if there's a regional outage or a cloud
  provider outage that affects the primary node.

Considerations and Recommendations
----------------------------------

Multi-cloud deployments have the same 
:ref:`considerations <arch-center-multi-region-considerations>` and 
:ref:`recommendations <arch-center-multi-region-rec-summary>` as other 
multi-region deployments.

.. important::

   There may be other considerations 
   for multi-cloud deployments that are not covered in the
   {+atlas-arch-center+}, such as cloud-provider-aware application-side
   settings. Contact {+ps+} team to create a strategy for your 
   {+service+} multi-cloud deployments that covers these considerations.
