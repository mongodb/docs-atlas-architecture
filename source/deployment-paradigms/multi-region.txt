Multi-region {+service+} deployments are {+cluster+}s set up across
more than one region. A multi-region deployment might have multiple regions
within the same geography (a large area like a continent or country), a single 
region in each of several geographies, or multiple regions in multiple 
geographies. Multi-region deployments:

- Enhance protection in the case of a :ref:`regional outage <arch-center-regional-outage>` 
  by automatically rerouting traffic to another region for continuous 
  availability and a smooth user experience. 

- Provide high performance and availability.

- Ensure you meet compliance requirements for :ref:`data sovereignty
  <arch-center-compliance-data-sovereignty>`, such as the EU's General Data 
  Protection Regulation (GDPR) law. You can set up one or more 
  clusters in the regions where you need to ensure data sovereignty, and configure 
  you architecture to write that specific data to the correct clusters. 
  Any public data can be distributed to all of the clusters. 
  
  For example, you have an application that requires the storage of EU customer's 
  data. You can create a multi-region deployment with clusters in ``eu-west-1`` 
  and ``eu-east-1``, ``ap-south-1`` and ``ap-northeast-1``, and ``us-east-1``. 
  You store EU customer data only in ``eu-west-1`` and ``eu-east-1`` to ensure 
  compliance with GDPR, APAC customer data to ``ap-south-1`` and ``ap-northeast-1``, 
  and distribute non-sensitive data to all 5 clusters. This ensures data 
  sovereignty while offering high availability if there's a regional 
  outage that affects one of the nodes.

.. note::

   Multi-region deployments are available only for ``M10`` dedicated
   {+clusters+} and larger.

Multi-Region Deployment Strategies
----------------------------------

The following image shows two architectures: a 5-node, 3-region configuration 
(2+2+1) and a 3-node, 3-region design (1+1+1). These paradigms, and others, are 
discussed in the sections that follow.

5-Node, 3-Region Architecture (2+2+1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a mission-critical application that requires both high availability 
and low latency, you need to deploy your MongoDB nodes and your application in 
multiple regions. Depending on your users' locations, you might need to deploy 
to regions in several different geographies. 

To achieve this level of availability and latency, we recommend an architecture 
that consists of a minimum of 5 nodes spread over at least 3 regions. This 
architecture provides high availability in at least 2 regions. If a node goes 
down, the traffic can be served from the same region to ensure the same latency 
on the primary region. 

The diagram above shows an example with 5 clusters in 3 different 
regions: 2 clusters in ``US3``, 2 in ``EU1``, and 1 in ``AP1``. This is the 
recommended architecture for large enterprises, because:

- It provides high availability and low latency for users in multiple geographies.
- It is a good strategy for complying with local regulations like GDPR. Individual 
  customer data that needs to comply with regulations can be isolated to the 
  cluster(s) in that region.
- It provides high availability in at least 2 regions. If a cluster is unavailable, 
  traffic can be served from the same region to ensure the same latency. 

The following diagram shows details of this architecture:

   :alt: An image showing three types of multi-region deployments

Notes and Considerations
````````````````````````

- Deploy your application servers in each region that MongoDB nodes are 
  deployed. This gives you the ability to route read requests to the in-region  
  node, which reduces the response time to your users, and offloads requests 
  from the primary node. Write requests are always directed to the primary.

- Use :atlas:`private endpoints <data-federation/admin/manage-private-endpoint/>`
  to connect to the cluster, and 
  :atlas:`VPC peering <atlas-stream-processing/manage-vpc-peering-connections/>` 
  between your application server VPCs. VPC peering ensures that if a network connection 
  is broken or {+service+} in that region goes down, the application tier can 
  still route to the primary node, first over the VPC peering, and then over the 
  private endpoint. 

- This architecture has the highest cost due to network traffic between regions 
  and having 5 or more data-bearing nodes. 

- This architecture provides the highest resiliency. There are no interruptions 
  during {+service+} operations (like an automated upgrade), and your application 
  can sustain a full regional failure with no interruption and manual 
  intervention required. 

.. _arch-center-multi-region-5+2:

5-Node, 2-Region Architecture (2+3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your company is limited to only 2 regions, you can use a variation on the 
5-Node, 3-Region  architecture, in which you have 5 nodes distributed between 
two regions. The primary region has 2 electable nodes, and the secondary region 
has 1 electable node and and 2 read-only (non-voting) nodes. 

This is not generally recommended if you can use 3 regions. However, it is a 
good option for customers with only 2 approved regions.

.. figure:: /includes/images/multi-region-2+3.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: An image showing three types of multi-region deployments

Notes and Considerations
````````````````````````
This architecture provides protection against data loss, even in full outage of 
the majority region, because the system remains available in read-only mode in 
the minority region. 

While this architecture is less expensive than the 5-Node, 3-Region solution 
provided above, the reduced cost comes with some caveats:

- If the majority region is lost, the minority region is not a fully-functional 
  cluster; it does not have a primary and can only accept reads but not writes.

  To turn it into a functional cluster again, an administrator needs to 
  reconfigure the 2 read-only nodes to electable nodes. However, there is a 
  possibility of data loss when the unavailable members are online again. If, 
  for example, the original primary in the majority region didn't replicate the 
  write operations to the new primary node, then the recovered replica set rolls 
  back these writes. Any new writes are placed in a special collection for 
  manual recovery. To learn more, refer to 
  :atlas:`Reconfigure a Replica Set During a Regional Outage </reconfigure-replica-set-during-regional-outage>`.

  .. note::

     If the *minority* region is lost, no action is required, since the majority  
     region remains a fully functional cluster.

- In sharded clusters, if your MongoDB process didn't replicate chunk migrations, 
  the data inconsistency might cause 
  :manual:`orphaned documents </reference/glossary/#term-orphaned-document>`.

Lower-Cost Variation
````````````````````
For further cost savings, you can design this architecture without the 2 read-only 
nodes. In addition to the caveats listed above, data size has a significant impact 
on your decision since the data needs to be synchronized to secondaries 
whenever adding new nodes to the cluster. For example, 1 TB of data averages 1
hour of recovery and synchronization time.

.. _arch-center-multi-region-3+3:

3-Node, 3-Region Architecture (1+1+1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an application that can experience temporary interruptions, and 
the cost of deployment is more of a factor than availability or latency, you 
can create an architecture that is less expensive by using 1 node in each of 
3 regions. You have a electable node in each of the regions, which means if the 
primary node is unavailable, there is latency as another node is elected primary 
and writes are routed to that region. However, you still have availability if 
any region is unavailable.

.. note::

   We do not generally recommend this configuration because regular, planned 
   maintenance of Atlas nodes will cause temporary interruptions.

Global Clusters 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Global {+service+} clusters are used in the most complex deployments, and 
therefore require very careful planning. In almost all cases, 
a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-region` can fulfill your needs.

You might consider a global deployment strategy if:

- You need a single global connection string.
- You need to perform global aggregations across all users.
- You need the ability to read/write for all users from everywhere 
  in one logical cluster, while also having regional reads/writes.

.. important::

   The complexity of global clusters results in many opinions on best 
   practices. The {+atlas-arch-center+} does not currently cover recommendations
   specific to global clusters. Contact {+ps+} team to discuss your 
   specific requirements.
