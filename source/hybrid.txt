Hybrid {+service+} deployments set up both: 

- **MongoDB {+clusters+} located in the cloud**. Cloud deployments
  can be:
  
  - In one or more regions
  - Spread across one or more cloud providers
  - Global deployments

- **MongoDB {+clusters+} located on premise**. On-premise
  deployments can be local deployments that you create with the
  {+atlas-cli+} or self-managed deployments in 
  :manual:`MongoDB Enterprise </administration/install-enterprise/>` or
  :manual:`MongoDB Community </administration/install-community/>`.

Hybrid deployments allow you to keep some data on premise for
development or compliance, while still leveraging
the following benefits of {+service+} cloud deployments:

- Scalability and cost savings
- High availability and low latency on a regional or global scale
- Features to help meet cloud compliance requirements for 
  :ref:`data sovereignty <arch-center-compliance-data-sovereignty>` 

To learn how to configure cloud deployments and learn about the
different types of nodes you can add, see :atlas:`Create a Cluster 
</tutorial/create-new-cluster/>` in the {+service+} documentation.

To learn how to configure an on-premise deployment, see the following
resources:

- :atlascli:`Create a Local {+service+} Deployment 
  </atlas-cli-deploy-local>` with the {+atlas-cli+}
- :manual:`Install MongoDB </installation/>` for self-managed
  deployments in MongoDB Enterprise or MongoDB Community

Use Case for Hybrid Deployments
-------------------------------

Hybrid deployments are best for the following use
cases:

Cloud-Based Applications with Local Development Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A hybrid deployment may be best for you if you have
the following requirements:

- You want to deploy your production workloads in the cloud, which
  allows you to scale your resources based on the needs of your
  application and pay only for the resources you use.
- You want to develop on local {+clusters+}, which reduces
  costs when compared to cloud-hosted development.
- You want to use a single cloud provider *or* multiple cloud providers.
- You want to deploy to one cloud region *or* multiple cloud regions.

If this is your use case, we recommend that you deploy locally 
by using the :atlascli:`{+atlas-cli+} </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`. You
can deploy your cloud databases as single-region, multi-region,
multi-cloud, or global deployments.

Use the following resources to select your cloud deployment type based
on your cloud needs:

- :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-single`
- :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-region`
- :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`
- :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-global`

Cloud-Based Applications with On-Premise Compliance Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A hybrid deployment may be best for you if you have
the following requirements:

- You want to deploy some production workloads in the cloud, which
  allows you to scale your resources based on the needs of your
  application and pay only for the resources you use.
- You want to deploy some production workloads on premise to meet
  internal compliance requirements.
- You want to use a single cloud provider *or* multiple cloud providers.
- You want to deploy to one cloud region *or* multiple cloud regions.

If this is your use case, we recommend that you deploy a self-managed
database with :manual:`MongoDB Enterprise 
</administration/install-enterprise/>` or :manual:`MongoDB Community 
</administration/install-community/>`. You can deploy
your cloud databases as single-region, multi-region, multi-cloud, or
global deployments.

Use the following resources to select your cloud deployment type based
on your cloud needs:

- :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-single`
- :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-region`
- :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`
- :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-global`

Recommendations for Hybrid Deployments
--------------------------------------

The {+atlas-arch-center+} does not currently cover recommendations
specific to hybrid deployments. Contact {+ps+}
team to create a custom landing zone for your {+service+} hybrid
deployments.
