Solution Overview
-----------------

The renewable energy sector is rapidly evolving with advancements in AI and
`machine learning <https://www.mongodb.com/basics/machine-learning>`__ ,
offering significant potential for efficiency gains and cost reductions, yet
much innovation remains untapped. By integrating AI into renewable energy
systems, new opportunities for efficiency gains and cost reductions emerge.

Companies are increasingly turning to predictive maintenance to increase
efficiency and reduce costs. However, this strategy comes with significant
challenges:

- The integration of heterogeneous data of diverse formats and sources
- Scalability becomes an issue due to the volume of IoT signals generated
- Real-time analysis of vast data sets
- Acquiring and effectively utilizing `unstructured data
  <https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/unstructured-data/unstructured-data>`__,
  hindering the development of robust predictive maintenance models

Our solution explores the application of AI in real-time anomaly detection
using sound input, highlighting the impact of MongoDB Atlas Vector Search.
This approach offers several benefits:

- Document data model: MongoDB's `BSON <https://www.mongodb.com/basics/bson>`__
  (binary JSON) format stores diverse data types, including unstructured data,
  simplifying maintenance and enabling faster responses to changes.
- Time series collections: MongoDB efficiently handles time-series data, crucial
  for real-time monitoring in predictive maintenance, ensuring timely
interventions.
- Real-time data processing: MongoDB enables immediate diagnostics and
  responses, vital for proactive maintenance to prevent costly repairs.
- Data aggregation: MongoDB's powerful aggregation capabilities provide
  comprehensive insights into fleet-wide performance trends.
- Atlas Vector Search: MongoDB Atlas facilitates effortless search of
  unstructured data, enabling robust predictive maintenance solutions with
  features like vector indexing and retrieval. Visit the

A fun and quick demo of MongoDB's Vector Search capabilities for anomaly
detection through sound input, using a basic handheld fan as our makeshift wind
turbine. This demo enables real-time diagnosis by analyzing the emitted audio,
allowing us to diagnose its condition—whether it's operating normally, stopped,
or experiencing any issues.

Reference architectures
-----------------------

**With MongoDB**: The solution demo is divided in two parts:

Audio preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We begin by capturing the audio from the equipment in different situations
(normal operation, high/low load, equipment obstructed, not operating).

Once each sound is collected, we use an embedding model to process the audio
data and convert it to vector embeddings (numerical representations of data).
This step is crucial — by generating embeddings for each audio track, which are
high-dimensional vector representations, we are essentially capturing the unique
characteristics of the sound.

We then upload these vectors to MongoDB Atlas, which is where the vector search
magic begins. With just a few examples of sounds in our database, they are ready
to be searched (and essentially compared) with the sound emitted by our
equipment during its operation in real-time.

Audio-based diagnosis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next we put our equipment through normal operation and start capturing the sound
it is making in real time. In this demonstration we capture one-second clips of
audio. Then, with the same embedding model used before, we take our audio clips
and convert them to vector embeddings in real-time. This process happens in
milliseconds, allowing us to have real-time monitoring of the audio. The
one-second audio clips now converted to vector embeddings are then sent to
MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. At this step, the Atlas Vector Search algorithm
searches for what is the most similar sound from the ones we previously recorded
in our audio preparation phase. The result is given back with a percentage of
similarity and it enables a very accurate diagnosis of the current status of the
operation of the wind turbine.

These steps are performed repeatedly every second, leveraging fast embedding of
vector data and quick searches, allowing for real-time monitoring based on
sound.

Data model approach
-------------------

The data model for the vectorized audio collection is simple, we have our audio
preparation collection called “sounds,” which contains documents including a
status and the url of the related GIF to be displayed on the UI. Once the
reference audio for each status is vectorized, the embedding is added to the
document as an array alongside existing fields.
