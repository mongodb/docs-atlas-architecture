|service-fullname| offers comprehensive tools and features to
effectively manage and control an organization's database costs,
especially as your usage expands. By providing user-friendly cost
optimization features, {+service+} enables you to better understand and
streamline your spending.

{+service+} Recommendations for Cost-Saving Configurations

Auto-Scaling {+Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service+} offers {+cluster+} auto-scaling for all tiers except the
highest tier, specifically under the general and low-CPU classes.

:ref:`Cluster auto-scaling <cluster-autoscaling>` enables {+clusters+}
to automatically adjust the tier, storage capacity, or both, in response
to real-time usage, helping users to maintain optimal performance
without manual intervention. {+service+} analyzes the CPU utilization
and memory utilization to determine when and whether to scale the
{+cluster+} tier up or down.

Users can also specify a range of maximum and minimum {+cluster+} sizes
that their {+cluster+} can automatically scale to. {+service+} won't
scale a {+cluster+} if the new tier falls outside a user's specified
size range or if memory usage would exceed the capacity of the new tier.

To learn more about the considerations for autoscaling, 
see :ref:`arch-center-scalability`. To learn more about {+cluster+}
sizes, see :ref:`arch-center-cluster-size-guide`.
