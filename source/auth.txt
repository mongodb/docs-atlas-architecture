Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.
|service| requires all users to authenticate themselves in order 
to determine their access. Authorization is the process of assigning 
permissions to an authenticated user.

For **:ref:`Authentication <arch-center-authentication-recs>`**, |service| 
provides robust authentication mechanisms that seamlessly integrate with your 
existing identity systems, providing secure access to the UI, database, and 
|api|\s.

For **:ref:`Authorization <arch-center-authorization-recs>`**, |service| 
provides Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to govern 
access to |service|. You must grant a user one or more roles that determine the
user's access to database resources and operations. Outside of role
assignments, the user has no access to the system.
