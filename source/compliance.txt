To help you address security and privacy requirements, MongoDB {+service+}
aims to deliver the highest levels of standards conformance and regulatory
compliance. MongoDB offers |atlas-trust|, a comprehensive compliance and
trust program for MongoDB {+service+}.

This section lists the key considerations that allow you to
enforce strict compliance controls for your deployments in {+service+}.

{+service+} Features and Best Practices for Compliance
------------------------------------------------------

Use the following {+service+} features to address compliance requirements:

- Encryption. 
  
  - Implement encryption to ensure data security and compliance
    across all stages of data handling:

    - Encrypt data in transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
    - Encrypt data at rest using AES-256 encryption.
    - Encrypt data in use to ensure privacy and regulatory compliance.

  - Use client-side encryption in {+service+} to protect data throughout its lifecycle.

  - Use queryable encryption to secure queries on encrypted data. With
    queryable encryption, sensitive information remains protected even
    when users run queries on data.

    Choose encryption configurations that support expressive queries.
    Use well-researched non-deterministic encryption schemes to maintain
    a balance between security and functionality.

- Data Sovereignty. {+service+} simplifies data sovereignty compliance
  through two key features:

  - Multi-cloud and multi-region clusters. Use multi-region and multi-cloud
    {+clusters+} to distribute data across geographically-diverse regions
    and cloud providers.

    Create {+clusters+} in any of the 110+ cloud regions across the three
    major cloud providers, |gcp|, |aws|, and |azure|. With {+service+},
    you can deploy dedicated MongoDB {+clusters+} in a specific cloud
    provider and region of your choice. This approach increases security,
    reduces the risk of localized failures, and ensures data redundancy.

    For example, a European company handling sensitive customer data can
    choose to deploy their MongoDB {+cluster+} in a data center located
    within the European Union, such as in Frankfurt, Germany, using |aws|
    or another cloud provider. By doing so, the company ensures that all
    data remains within EU borders and complies with
    the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).

  - Global {+clusters+} with zoned sharding. Use global {+clusters+} to
    control data storage locations. You can partition and store data in
    your database into distinct zones, each situated in a different
    geographical location. 

    For example, you can store European customer data in Europe, while
    storing U.S. customer data in the U.S. This allows you to comply with
    data sovereignty regulations and reduces latency for users accessing
    data from their respective regions.

- Certifications and compliance with regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

  {+service+} has ISO/IEC 27001 and 9001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and FedRAMP
  certifications. These certifications serve as a foundation for meeting
  industry-specific regulatory requirements. Use these certifications
  to ensure that your data practices align with necessary compliance demands
  while maintaining robust security controls.

- MongoDB Atlas Compliance and Attestations. {+service+} data platform
  undergoes rigorous independent audits to verify its security, privacy,
  and organizational controls. These audits help ensure that the platform
  meets compliance and regulatory requirements, including those specific
  to highly-regulated industries.
  
  {+service+}  has obtained the following certifications:

  - ISO/IEC 27001:2022: Global standard for information security management systems.
  - ISO/IEC 27017:2015: Global standard for cloud-specific security controls.
  - ISO/IEC 27018:2019: Global standard for protecting sensitive data (PII) on the cloud.
  - ISO 9001:2015: Globally recognized standard for Quality Management.
  - PCI DSS: Requirements for processing and accessing credit card data.
  - HIPAA: U.S. privacy regulation safeguarding health information.
  - GDPR: Privacy protections for data in the EU and EEA.
  - IRAP: Australian government cybersecurity assessment framework.
  - TX-RAMP: Texas Risk and Authorization Management Program.
  - TISAX: Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange for automotive industries.
  - HDS: French standard for hosting health data (Hébergeur de Données de Santé).

- Multi-region snapshot distribution. Distribute backup snapshots and oplog data
  across multiple regions. For example, you can satisfy compliance requirements
  and store backups in different, air-gapped geographical locations to
  ensure disaster recovery in case of regional outages.

- Backup compliance policy. Secure business-critical data by preventing all
  backup snapshots and oplog data stored in {+service+} from being modified
  or deleted for a predefined retention period by any user, regardless of
  their {+service+} role. This guarantees that your backups are fully
  WORM (Write Once Read Many)-compliant. Only a designated, authorized
  point of contact can turn off this protection after completing a
  verification process with MongoDB support.
