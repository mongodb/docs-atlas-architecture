|service| offers encryption features to protect data while in transit, at rest, and in use to safeguard data through its full lifecycle.

{+service+} Features and Recommendations for Data Encryption
------------------------------------------------------------

Features 
~~~~~~~~

Encryption in Transit
`````````````````````

Encryption in transit secures data during transmission between clients and servers, 
ensuring that your data cannot be inspected while in motion.
In |service|, all network traffic to {+clusters+} is protected by Transport Layer 
Security (TLS) 1.2+, which is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
Data transmitted to and between nodes is encrypted in transit using TLS, ensuring secure communication throughout.

Encryption at Rest
``````````````````

Encryption at rest ensures that all data on disk are encrypted.
In |service|, customer data is automatically encrypted at rest.
This process utilizes your cloud provider's disk encryption, with the provider managing the encryption keys. This process cannot be disabled.
Additionally, you have the option to enable database-level encryption, allowing you to use :ref:`your own encryption keys <security-kms-encryption>`
with AWS Key Management Service (KMS), Google Cloud KMS, or Azure Key Vault.

In-use Encryption
`````````````````

Encryption in use secures data while it's being processed.
MongoDB has two features for encryption in use to meet your data protection needs: Client-Side Field-Level Encryption and Queryable Encryption.

Client-Side Field-Level Encryption
##################################

:ref:`Client-Side Field-Level Encryption <manual-csfle-feature>` (CSFLE) is an in-use encryption capability
that enables a client application to encrypt sensitive data before storing it in the MongoDB database.
Sensitive data is transparently encrypted, remains encrypted throughout its lifecycle, and is only decrypted on the client side.

Queryable Encryption
####################

:ref:`Queryable Encryption <qe-manual-feature-qe>` helps organizations protect sensitive data when it is queried.
It allows applications to encrypt sensitive data on the client side, securely store it in the database, and perform equality
and range queries directly on the encrypted data.
This ensures protection for sensitive information without sacrificing the ability to perform queries on it.

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For development and testing environments, do not enable added encryption with :ref:`your own encryption keys <security-kms-encryption>` through AWS Key Management Service (KMS), Google Cloud KMS, or Azure Key Vault. This saves costs in your 
non-production environments.

For staging and production environments, enable added encryption with :ref:`your own encryption keys <security-kms-encryption>` through AWS Key Management Service (KMS), Google Cloud KMS, or Azure Key Vault for
additional security.
