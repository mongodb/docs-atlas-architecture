Multi-region {+service+} deployments set up {+cluster+} nodes across
multiple geographic regions. Multi-region
deployments enhance protection in the case of a :ref:`regional outage
<arch-center-regional-outage>` by automatically rerouting traffic to a
node in another region for continuous availability and a
smooth user experience. Multi-region deployments can also enhance
performance and can help meet
compliance requirements for :ref:`data sovereignty
<arch-center-compliance-data-sovereignty>`.

To learn how to configure multi-region deployments and learn about the
different types of nodes you can add, see 
:atlas:`Configure High Availability and Workload Isolation 
</cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/>` in the {+service+}
documentation.

Multi-region deployments can deploy nodes
across a single cloud provider or multiple cloud providers. As each
cloud provider has its own set of regions, multi-cloud deployments are
also multi-region deployments. To learn about multi-cloud deployments,
see :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`.

The following diagram shows a multi-region, single-cloud {+service+}
deployment for regions that support availability zones:

Use Cases for Multi-Region Deployments
--------------------------------------

To learn the use cases for multi-region, multi-cloud deployments, see
:ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`.

Multi-region, single-cloud deployments are best for the following use
cases:

Region-Specific Applications that Require Low Latency and High Availability Within One Cloud Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve performance for critical operations,
all {+service+} deployments allow you to deploy data
close to your users' geographic location, which reduces latency. However, deploying to a single region sacrifices high availability if
there is a regional outage. 
You can configure a multi-region, single-cloud deployment for both
high availability and low latency.

A multi-region, single-cloud deployment may be best for you if you have
the following requirements:

- You want to use a single cloud provider 
- You want to deploy to more than one region for high availability
- Your application requires low latency *and* has a majority of users
  in one geographic location, since multi-region deployments allow you
  to deploy nodes to different regions within the same geographic area.

For example, for an application deployed with |aws| with users
primarily located in the US, you can deploy a multi-region deployment
to three regions within the US (such as ``us-east-1``, ``us-east-2``,
and ``us-west-2``). This
ensures low latency since all regions are within the US, while offering
high availability if there's a regional outage that affects the primary
node in ``us-east-1``.

If your application requires low latency for users in any region across
a global user base, consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-global`.

If your application requires low latency but doesn't require
cross-region high
availability, consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-single`.

If your application requires low latency, high availability, and
deployment across
multiple cloud providers, consider a
:ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`.

Applications that Require Data Sovereignty and High Availability Within One Cloud Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For compliance with data residency laws, data can be partitioned to
reside in specific regions, ensuring adherence to local regulations.
However, deploying to a single region sacrifices high availability if
there is a regional outage. 
You can configure a multi-region, single-cloud deployment for both
high availability and data sovereignty.

A multi-region, single-cloud deployment may be best for you if you have
the following requirements:

- You want to use a single cloud provider 
- You want to deploy to more than one region for high availability
- Your application requires data sovereignty, since multi-region
  deployments allow you to deploy nodes to different regions within the
  same geographic area.

For example, for an application deployed with |aws| that requires data
storage in Europe, you can deploy a multi-region deployment
to three regions within the EU (such as ``eu-west-1``,
``eu-west-2``, and ``eu-west-3``). This
ensures data sovereignty since all regions are within the EU, while
offering high availability if there's a regional outage that affects
the primary node in ``eu-west-1``.

If your application requires data sovereignty but doesn't require
cross-region high
availability, consider a :ref:`arch-center-paradigms-single`.

If your application requires data sovereignty and deployment across
multiple cloud providers, consider a
:ref:`arch-center-paradigms-multi-cloud`.

Considerations for Multi-Region Deployments
-------------------------------------------

Other considerations for multi-region deployments include:

- High availability depends on the deployment of nodes across
  regions as well as the number, distribution, and priority order of
  nodes. To learn more about recommended
  {+cluster+} topologies for high availability, see
  :ref:`arch-center-high-availability`.
- Multi-region deployments are available only for ``M10`` dedicated
  {+clusters+} and larger.

For more considerations, see 
:atlas:`Considerations 
</cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution/#considerations>` in the
{+service+} documentation.
