A landing zone is a framework for establishing a well-architected and
pre-configured cloud environment. An {+service+} landing zone defines organization-specific requirements
for operational efficiency, security, reliability, performance, and cost,
as well as the tools, procedures, and {+service+} configurations that teams must use to meet these requirements. 
We recommend that all enterprise customers design a landing zone before moving workloads to MongoDB {+service+}.

Designing and implementing a landing zone can help you avoid expensive 
efforts to redesign initial setups later down the line. 
For example, while in talks to move their on-premises databases to MongoDB {+service+}, 
one of our recent enterprise customers voiced concerns over how peer financial services 
companies were struggling to enforce standards for security and cost-efficiency across teams. 
One peer had faced security risks due to inconsistent encryption policies across business units,
while another had accumulated runaway cloud costs due to forgotten and redundant servers.
To avoid these risks, our enterprise customer partnered with MongoDB's Professional Services team
to design a landing zone that aligns all teams and stakeholders on requirements
including encryption at rest with {+byok+} and FinOps integrations to tag and track spending.

What Are Some Landing Zone Considerations?
------------------------------------------

As you create your landing zone, define requirements for the following considerations 
and consider how your requirements align with {+service+}'s default configurations.

Critical Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before moving any workload to MongoDB {+service+}, design a landing zone 
that defines requirements for the following critical considerations: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 50 35 

   * - Consideration
     - Description
     - Default Configuration
   * - System Hierarchy
     - Choose a deployment hierarchy that groups your {+service+} organizations, projects, and clusters
       in order to isolate between business units, environments, and billable groups as needed. 
       For example, you can group business units into individual organizations to ensure that 
       sales credentials cannot authenticate to product resources. 
       
       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see
       :ref:`arch-center-hierarchy`.
   * - Security
     - Define security requirements including the following: 

       - Principals and mechanisms for how to authenticate and authorize access to 
         the |service| control plane (|service| UI and {+atlas-admin-api+}), database resources, and database operations
       - Standards for data encryption in transit, at rest, and in use
       - Network security configurations, such as requiring |tls-ssl| connection encryption, private endpoints and |vpc| connections 
         to isolate your data flow from the public internet

       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see the following pages:

       - :ref:`arch-center-auth`
       - :ref:`arch-center-data-encryption`
       - :ref:`arch-center-network-security`
     - By default, all access to your clusters is blocked and 
       you must explicitly allow inbound connections through your IP access list or with {+vpc+} peering.
       Atlas requires all users to authenticate to access {+service+} resources, and administrators must 
       set up authentication and authorization methods. 
       {+service+} automatically encrypts data in transit using |tls| and data at rest using :ref:`cloud provider disk encryption <security-kms-encryption>`. 
   * - Compliance
     - Consider how your deployment's data residency determines data sovereignty
       and therefore which laws apply to your data. Identify and account for any specific legal and regulatory
       requirements not clearly articulated within other categories of requirements. 

       Your data residency depends on which regions and geographies you choose to deploy to in your deployment paradigm, 
       and whether you choose to partition your data between geographies.  

       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see the following pages:

       - :ref:`arch-center-compliance`
       - :ref:`arch-center-paradigms`
   * - Disaster Recovery
     - Define and record a disaster recovery plan that meets the following criteria: 
     
       - Defines an optimal |rpo| and |rpo| for your organization
       - Defines a backup snapshot schedule and requirements for snapshot retention and mutli-region distribution 
       - Identifies recovery methods such as snapshot restores, queryable backups, document versioning, region shifting, 
         or provider pivot
       - Defines disaster recovery procedures for possible disaster scenarios such as zonal, regional, or cloud-provider 
         outages, resource failures, data corruption events, and more. 

       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see
       the following pages: 
       
       - :ref:`arch-center-dr`
       - :ref:`arch-center-backups`
   * - High Availability
     - Set standards for high availability that ensure system operation during planned or 
       unplanned outages. These requirements will partially determine the number of nodes, 
       regions, and cloud providers in your deployment paradigm. 

       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see
       the following pages: 

       - :ref:`arch-center-high-availability`
       - :ref:`arch-center-paradigms`
     - {+service+} automatically configures a minimum three-node replica set when you launch a new cluster,
       and supports automatic failover if a primary replica set member experiences an outage. If you deploy 
       to a region that supports availability zones, {+service+} automatically distributes nodes across zones. 
       Deploying to additional regions, geographies, and cloud providers can provide additional availability in the case of 
       regional, geographic, or cloud provider outages. 
   * - Billing
     - Identify any specific requirements for billing, such as
       integrations with FinOps tools for reporting and charge-back.
       You can build these requirements into the automation and
       provisioning process for {+service+} {+clusters+} to facilitate
       this integration.

       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see
       :ref:`arch-center-billing-data`.
     - MongoDB Charts billing dashboards contain prebuilt charts that display 
       billing data across categories and periods of time. 

Advanced Considerations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To design a more comprehensive landing zone, consider definiing requirements for the following advanced considerations: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 50 35 

   * - Consideration
     - Description
     - Default Configuration
   * - Data Retention
     - Identify and record your data retention policies. This may
       require creating a classification for automation, including
       creation of archive or purge automation. In some cases, data
       must be preserved for a certain duration, whereas in other cases
       data must be purged after some duration. Identify performance
       characteristics of retrieval of archived records.
   * - Monitoring and Observability
     - Set standards for observability that define which logs and metrics you will monitor and how you will monitor them. For example, set up
       external system integrations that ingest {+service+} log files, audit logs, or activity feed data, 
       or configure alerts and reporting guidelines for certain event types.

       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see
       the following pages:
       
       - :ref:`arch-center-monitoring-alerts`.
       - :ref:`arch-center-auditing-logging`.
   * - Auditing and Change Control
     - Define  any auditing or change control requirements. This
       can include change approval processes and tools, along with
       reporting guidelines.

       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see
       :ref:`arch-center-auditing-logging`.
   * - Maintenance
     - Identify whether you have any specific requirements regarding
       Maintenance windows or upgrade deferments.
     - {+service+} automatically performs maintenance on your cluster in a rolling manner, 
       but you can configure custom maintenance windows or protected hours for more control 
       over when maintenance and standard updates can occur. 

Design Your Landing Zone
------------------------

MongoDB's Professional Services team partners with enterprise
customers to create custom landing zones for {+service+}. If you're
working with MongoDB's Professional Services, the resources on this
page can also help you plan for those discussions.

Use the following resources as a starting point for your {+service+} landing zone.
Designing a landing zone is an iterative process that involves reviewing
and realigning standards across teams. We recommend that you compile all diagrams, recommendations, and
examples in a document and adjust them to meet your organization's requirements.

Example Landing Zone Diagram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example diagram unifies many of the architectural diagrams
across the {+atlas-arch-center+} in one image to visualize your
landing zone. You can adjust it as needed to customize it for your organization.

Information In The {+atlas-arch-center+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To begin, copy the relevant guidance and examples in :ref:`arch-center-hierarchy`, which helps you create your first foundational components in {+service+}.

Then, review the guidance and examples for each of the pages nested under each {+waf+} pillar in the {+atlas-arch-center+}. Copy the
diagrams, recommendations, tools, and examples that are relevant for
your organization.

.. include:: /includes/complete-examples.rst

The {+atlas-arch-center+} pages include:

- Operational Efficiency

  - :ref:`arch-center-automation`
  - :ref:`arch-center-monitoring-alerts`
- Security

  - :ref:`arch-center-network-security`
  - :ref:`arch-center-auth`
  - :ref:`arch-center-data-encryption`
  - :ref:`arch-center-compliance`
  - :ref:`arch-center-auditing-logging`
- Reliability

  - :ref:`arch-center-high-availability`
  - :ref:`arch-center-resiliency`
  - :ref:`arch-center-backups`
  - :ref:`arch-center-dr`
- Performance

  - :ref:`arch-center-scalability`
- Cost Optimization

  - :ref:`arch-center-cost-saving-config`
  - :ref:`arch-center-billing-data`

Your Organization's Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adjust the example landing zone diagram, recommendations, and examples
that you copied from the {+atlas-arch-center+} to fit your
organization's specific requirements. For example, if you use only 
{+gcp+} as a cloud provider, your landing zone should specify that
requirement and you should exclude any recommendations and examples
applicable only to |aws| and |azure|.

To identify more considerations and requirements specific to your
organization, see the previous section on
:ref:`Landing Zone Considerations <landing-zone-considerations>`.
