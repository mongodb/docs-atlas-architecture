To monitor and log |service| platform activities, use auditing and logs.

Features for {+service+} Auditing and Logging
---------------------------------------------

.. _auditing:

Auditing
~~~~~~~~

Available on ``M10+`` {+clusters+}, database auditing lets you track system 
activity for deployments with
multiple users. As an |service| administrator, you can:

- Rely on default auditing settings in |service|. By default, |service|
  performs database authentication auditing in ``M10+`` {+clusters+} to
  record authentication events, including those pertaining to:

  - database users
  - source IP addresses
  - timestamps for successful and failed attempts

- :atlas:`Configure a JSON-formatted audit filter 
  </database-auditing/#configure-a-custom-auditing-filter>` to
  customize MongoDB auditing
  and select the actions, database users, |service| roles, and |ldap| groups
  that you want to audit. If you create a custom audit filter, you can
  skip using the managed {+atlas-ui+} auditing filter builder and configure
  your own tailored filter of event auditing. For a full list of
  events you can configure for auditing, and for a list of examples,
  see :manual:`MongoDB auditing </core/auditing>` and :atlas:`Example Auditing Filters 
  </database-auditing/#example-auditing-filters>`.
  
  You can :manual:`configure manual auditing </core/auditing>` of most of the
  documented :manual:`system event actions </reference/audit-message/mongo/#audit-event-actions--details--and-results>`
  in |service|. Granular MongoDB database auditing allows you to track
  usage of all DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language),
  and DCL (Data Control Language) commands in detail. See also
  :atlas:`Set up Database Auditing </database-auditing>`.

.. _accessing-audit-logs:

Accessing Audit Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/cloud-docs/logs.rst

You can review and update your auditing configuration per project. Use
the following {+atlas-cli+} commands:

- :ref:`atlas auditing describe <atlas-auditing-describe>` returns the
  auditing configuration for the specified project.
- :ref:`atlas auditing update <atlas-auditing-update>` updates
  the auditing configuration for the specified project.

You can :ref:`view authentication attempts <access-tracking>` that users make
against your {+cluster+} with the {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, or {+atlas-ui+}.
|service| logs both successful and unsuccessful authentication attempts,
including the timestamp of each attempt and which user tried to authenticate.

You can also :ref:`view and filter the activity feed <view-activity-feed>`
for an organization or project with the {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-admin-api+},
or {+atlas-ui+}. The activity feed lists all events at the organization or project level.

To perform a full audit, you can use a combination of audit logs,
:manual:`MongoDB log messages </reference/log-messages/>`, and
:ref:`the project and organization activity feed <view-activity-feed>`.

All Deployment Paradigm Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following recommendations apply to all :ref:`deployment paradigms
<arch-center-paradigms>`.

We recommend that you :atlas:`set up database auditing </database-auditing>`
when you provision your {+clusters+}. 
Auditing puts additional load on your {+clusters+} and increases costs. 
To optimize costs, you can disable auditing in lower environments for development. 
Certain industries, such as healthcare and financial services, may opt to keep 
auditing enabled in development environments for compliance reasons.

Enabling auditing for all database users, including application
service users, might affect cluster performance. We recommend that you
audit only the actions of users that require auditing.

For staging and production environments, enable auditing for
additional security.

We recommend that you audit the following events at a minimum:

- Failed logon
- Session activity
- Logon and logoff
- Attempts to perform unauthorized functions
- Password change
- Database User Access changes
- DDL & System configuration stored procedures
- Modification of Native audit
- Running a backup or restore operation
- Altering DBMS native audit settings
- Altering security
- Running database start and stop commands

Audit log messages 
Following the default :manual:`mongo schema </reference/audit-message/mongo/>`, audit log messages include the following information:

- Action type 
- Timestamp 
- Client connection ID (UUID) 
- Client IP address and port number
- Incoming connection IP address and port numbe
- Username(s)
- User authentication database(s)
- User role(s)
- User role database(s)
- ``param`` document containing specific details for the event 
- Error code (if applicable)   

To learn more about the ``mongo`` schema and see a full list of audit action types
and their associated return values, see :manual:`mongo Schema Audit Messages </reference/audit-message/mongo/>`.

Recommendations for Programmatic Access to Audit Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>>>>>>> 03ec61c ((DOCSP-47103) Fix links and reorganize download logs.)

To integrate with tools beyond the built-in integrations, we recommend
that you retrieve logs with the following programmatic tools and feed
the JSON-formatted output to your external tools:

- To continually push logs to an |aws| |s3| bucket, use the {+atlas-admin-api+}
  endpoints for :oas-atlas-tag:`Push-Based Log Export <Push-Based-Log-Export>`.
- To retrieve deployment logs and lists of project events,
  use the {+atlas-admin-api+} endpoints for :oas-atlas-tag:`Logs <MongoDB-Cloud-Users>`
  and :oas-atlas-tag:`Project and Organization Events <Events>`.
- To retrieve deployment logs, use the :ref:`atlas deployment logs <atlas-deployments-logs>`
  command in the {+atlas-cli+}. 

Automation Examples: {+service+} Auditing and Logging
-----------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/complete-examples.rst

The following examples show how to retrieve and download logs and configure auditing
using |service| :ref:`tools for automation <arch-center-automation>`.

In addition to the following examples, see the blogpost
`Streamlining Log Management to Amazon S3 Using Atlas Push-based Log Exports With HashiCorp Terraform <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/streamlining-log-management-amazon-s3-atlas-push-based-log-exports-hashicorp-terraform/>`__.

      :tabid: cli

      Create and Enable Audit Filter
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      The following audit filter document only audits the
      authentication operations that occur against the test database. 
      To learn more, see :manual:`Configure Audit Filters </tutorial/configure-audit-filters/>`.

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-audit-filter.rst

      To enable an audit filter, run the :ref:`atlas auditing update <atlas-auditing-update>`
      command with the ``--enabled`` flag and specify the audit filter document in single quotes
      to pass the document as a string: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-audit-filter-use.rst

      The following {+atlas-cli+} command enables an audit filter that is defined in 
      the specified JSON configuration file: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-audit-logs-config-file.rst

      Update Audit Configuration
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To update your project's audit configuration, use the :ref:`atlas auditing update <atlas-auditing-describe>`
      command and specify the new audit filter. The following command replaces the existing 
      audit filter configuration with a new filter that audits all authentication events for known users in the project: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-audit-logs-known-users.rst

      Describe Audit Configuration
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Run the :ref:`atlas auditing describe <atlas-auditing-describe>`
      command to return the auditing configuration for the specified project:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-audit-logs-describe.rst

      Retrieve Logs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Each |mongod| and |mongos| instance in a cluster outputs its own
      :manual:`MongoDB log </reference/log-messages/>` and audit log messages with potentially different contents. 
      You can view these log messages in the {+atlas-cli+} using the 
      :ref:`atlas deployment logs <atlas-deployments-logs>` command. 

      To retrieve audit log entries for a |mongod| instance in your cluster, 
      provide the |mongod| hostname and specify ``mongodb-audit-log.gz`` as the name of the audit log file: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-retrieve-audit-logs-mongod.rst

      To retrieve audit log entries for a |mongos| instance in a sharded cluster deployment, 
      provide the |mongos| hostname and specify ``mongos-audit-log.gz`` as the name of the audit log file: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-retrieve-audit-logs-mongos.rst

      To retrieve :manual:`MongoDB log messages </reference/log-messages/>` in the {+atlas-cli+}, 
      specify ``mongodb.gz`` or ``mongos.gz`` as the name of the log file for your specified |mongod| or |mongos| 
      host, respectively: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-retrieve-logs.rst

      You can also use the :ref:`atlas accessLogs list <atlas-accessLogs-list>` command to view the access log for
      a node or cluster.
      The access log is a JSON-formatted list of all authentication requests against your specified node or cluster. 
      To retrieve the access log, run the :ref:`atlas accessLogs list <atlas-accessLogs-list>` command 
      and specify the hostname or {+cluster+} name of the target node or {+cluster+}: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-retrieve-access-logs.rst

      Download Logs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Each |mongod| and |mongos| instance in a cluster has its own
      :manual:`MongoDB log </reference/log-messages/>` and audit log with potentially different contents. 
      You can download each log as a compressed file using the 
      :ref:`atlas logs download <atlas-deployments-logs>` {+atlas-cli+} command. 

      To download the audit log for a |mongod| instance in your cluster, 
      run the :ref:`atlas logs download <atlas-deployments-logs>` command and provide 
      the |mongod| hostname and the audit log file name ``mongodb-auditlog.gz`` as arguments: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-download-audit-logs-mongod.rst

      To downlaod the audit log for a |mongos| instance in a sharded cluster deployment, 
      run the :ref:`atlas logs download <atlas-deployments-logs>` command and provide 
      the |mongos| hostname and the audit log file name ``mongos-auditlog.gz`` as arguments: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-download-audit-logs-mongos.rst

      To download the :manual:`MongoDB log </reference/log-messages/>` for a |mongod| or |mongos| instance, 
      run the :ref:`atlas logs download <atlas-deployments-logs>` command and provide as arguments 
      the hostname of the instance and the log file names ``mongodb.gz`` or ``mongos.gz``, respectively: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-download-logs.rst

      Retrieve All Log Events for Organization in a JSON File
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To return all events for the specified organization, use a command
      similar to the following. This command returns a JSON-formatted list
      of events for the organization with the ID ``5dd5a6b6f10fab1d71a58495``:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-retrieve-logs-org.rst

   .. tab:: Terraform
      :tabid: Terraform
 
      The following example demonstrates how to enable auditing for
      your deployment. Before you can create resources with Terraform,
      you must:

      - :ref:`Create your paying organization <configure-paying-org>`
        and :ref:`create an API key <atlas-admin-api-access>` for the
        paying organization. Store your public and private keys as
        environment variables by running the following commands in the terminal:

        .. code-block::

           export MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY="<insert your public key here>"
           export MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY="<insert your private key here>"

      - `Install Terraform <https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli>`__.

      Enable Auditing and Create an Auditing Filter for the {+Cluster+}
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      You can :manual:`configure manual auditing </core/auditing>` of most of the
      documented :manual:`system event actions </reference/audit-message/mongo/>`
      by creating audit filters. To learn more about configuring audit filters,
      see :manual:`Configure Audit Filters </tutorial/configure-audit-filters/>`.

      .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-auditing-filter.rst

      Retrieve Logs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      You can't retrieve logs with Terraform. Instead, use the following
      {+atlas-admin-api+} endpoints:

      - Use :oas-atlas-tag:`Access Tracking Admin API </Access-Tracking>`
        to return access logs for all authentication attempts for the database,
        identified by the cluster's name or hostname.

      - Use :oas-atlas-tag:`Monitoring and Logs APIs </Monitoring-and-Logs>`
        to retrieve a compressed log file with log messages for the specified
        host.
