Live migrate data from your on-premises MongoDB deployments to |service| using an 
automated process designed to transfer your data securely, accurately, and efficiently, with 
minimal cutover time. You can pull data from an on-premises MongoDB database, or 
push data using |com|, but with either method, |service| live migration includes 
the following features:

- The migration host always encrypts traffic to the |service| {+cluster+}. To encrypt 
  data end-to-end, enable |tls| on your source {+cluster+}. Only users with specific 
  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) :ref:`roles <authorization>` 
  (such as :authrole:`backup`, :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`, or :authrole:`clusterMonitor`) 
  can initiate live migration. Users authenticate to {+clusters+} using 
  :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-1 or SCRAM-SHA-256 </core/security-scram/>`.

- Live migration automates most tasks. You specify the resource requirements 
  and scalable options to prevent over-provisioning.

- Detailed instructions help you provision migration hosts and scale destination {+clusters+} 
  to control costs. Recommendations include appropriate {+cluster+} sizing 
  and temporary scaling, followed by resizing to optimal levels post-migration.

- Live migration uses |mongosync| to facilitate fast cutover through parallel data copying.
  Processes manage temporary network interruptions and {+cluster+} elections, using continuous 
  data synchronization and a final cutover phase to achieve minimal downtime. Retry 
  mechanisms and pre-migration validations enhance resilience against interruptions.

- Monitor migrations with real-time status updates and notifications.

Live Migration Methods
----------------------

|service| live migration automates moving data from on-premises MongoDB databases to |service|.
The methods differ depending on if you use |com| to push data into |service|, or 
a live migration server to pull data into |service|.

Both live migration methods require that the source and destination databases run 
MongoDB 6.0.13+ or MongoDB 7.0.8+. You can migrate data from databases using prior 
versions of MongoDB, but the process requires more manual intervention. 
To learn more, see `Legacy Migration <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/legacy-migration/>`__. 

* **Pull data into Atlas.** |service| pulls data from the source MongoDB deployment 
  and requires access to the source deployment through the deployment's firewall. When the 
  {+clusters+} are nearly synced, you must stop write operations on the source, 
  redirect applications to the |service| {+cluster+} and restart them. 
  This method is best for deployments not monitored by |com|. This method does not support 
  :ref:`VPC peering <vpc-peering>` or :ref:`private endpoints <private-endpoint>` 
  for either the source or destination {+cluster+}. 
  To learn more, see :ref:`c2c-pull-live-migration`.

* **Push data into Atlas.** |com| push data to |service| using a secure :term:`link-token` 
  without requiring access to the source {+cluster+} through the {+cluster+}'s firewall.
  During migration, |service| continuously syncs real-time data between the source 
  and destination {+clusters+} until cutover. This method supports 
  :ref:`VPC peering <vpc-peering>` and :ref:`private endpoints <private-endpoint>`.
